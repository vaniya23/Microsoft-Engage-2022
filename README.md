This repository contains all the files of my **Project** on **Data Analysis of Automotive Industry**. 

**Instructions for going through the project** : 

When you open the index.html file there is a possibility that the Powe BI report that I have embedded in the index.html file won't open due to security features of Microsoft Power BI. So, I request you to check out the same report using the Automotive Industry Data Analysis.pbix file that I have provided in this repo.

**Description of the project** :

For this project I used Jupyter Notebook for Exploratory Data Analysis and cleaning of data. Then I worked on Microsoft Power BI for working on the data, extracting information and visual representation of extracted information in the form of charts. Another major reason for using Power BI was its AI based QnA feature.
I also used HTML and CSS for creating the Power BI embedded webpage.

**Deatils about the raw data given** :

The data provided in the form of CSV file had information about companies that are producers and manufacturers of cars. It had details about different models and their variants manufactured by these companies, along with their features, specifications and prices. For eg. there was information about Tata Nano Genx, its variants like XT, XE, EMAX XM etc. that are available in the market, their features, specifications and price.

**The generated report displays information about** :

The number of cars manufactured by different companies that are present in our data. 

The different fuel types of the cars and the number of cars produced of a particular fuel type.

Mileage Class - the number of cars that are manufactured belonging to the categories - Economic, Fuel efficient, Average and Poor.

The number of cars that are produced of each transmission types i.e Manual, Automatic, AMT, DCT and CVT.

The number of cars with advance features like - automatic headlamps, rain sensing wipers, voice recognition etc.

The number of cars manufactured by companies of a particular car body type.

Contribution of companies in different price segments of cars.

The report also has the **QnA component** embedded in it which uses Natural Language Processing and can be used to fetch any information related to the given data/report by just entering a query which consists keywords related to the data.
